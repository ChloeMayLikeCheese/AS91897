ONLY the final release is meant for the assesment, the rest I have just used as an easier way to transfer files across multiple devices for testing

# Usage  
Just run the jar from the last release and run it with  

```bash
java -jar AS91897-all.jar
```
Controls:
Create file = 'c' (Put a / at the end to make it a directory)   
Help: = 'h'   
Rename = 'r'   
Previous directory = Left arrow or 'j' on windows   
Enter selected directory = Right arrow or 'l' on windows   
Navigate up directory list = Up arrow or 'i'    
Navigate down directory list = Down arrow or 'k' on windows   
Delete = Backspace or 'd' on windows   
Search = 's'   
Refresh = 'f'   
Press Crtl+C to exit file creation, renaming and deletion or 'q' to quit the program or help menu
